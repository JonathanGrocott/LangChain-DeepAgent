# CNC Machine Maintenance Guide

## Safety Procedures
Before performing any maintenance on CNC machines, ensure:
1. Main power is disconnected and locked out (LOTO).
2. Emergency stop button is engaged.
3. All moving parts have come to a complete stop.

## Routine Maintenance Schedule

### Daily Checks
- Check coolant levels.
- Inspect hydraulic pressure.
- Clean chip pans.
- Verify lubrication oil levels.

### Weekly Checks
- Check air pressure regulator.
- Clean air filters.
- Grease chuck and tailstock.

### Monthly Checks
- Inspect belt tension.
- Check axis backlash.
- Verify spindle alignment.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Vibration / Chatter
If the machine is vibrating excessively:
1. Check tool condition (worn tools cause chatter).
2. Verify workpiece clamping is secure.
3. Check spindle bearings for wear.
4. Inspect periodic error compensation settings.

### Overheating
If the spindle overheats:
1. Check cooling fan operation.
2. Verify coolant flow rate.
3. Inspect for blocked air vents.
4. Check ambient temperature (max 40°C).

## Error Codes
- **E001**: E-Stop pressed. Release button and reset.
- **E002**: Spindle overload. Reduce feed rate or check for tool dullness.
- **E003**: Low lubrication pressure. Refill oil reservoir.
